1. Unzip the add-logo-to-admin.zip file.
2. Upload the `add-logo-to-admin` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
4. Go to Settings => Add Logo to Admin and set your options and add your logo.

== Frequently Asked Questions == 

1) How do I add my own logo?

Just go to Settings => Add Logo to Admin and upload the logo you would like to use.

2) How big does my logo need to be?

Your logo should not exceed 326px by 67px or it will not fit perfectly on the login screen.
